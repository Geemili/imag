# Contributing to imag

Prerequisites:

* cargo and rust compiler in current version (stable)

In particular, we seek the following types of contributions:

* Ideas: What is a PIM module you want to see implemented or (even better) could
  you implement yourself?
* Testing: Feel free to test `imag`. Note that we have no release yet.
* Documentation: We want to have 100% documentation coverage. If you find
  something undocumented or wrongly documented, don't hesitate to fix it and
  send a PR!

# Commit guidelines, PR guidelines:

Please don't refer to issues or PRs from inside a commit message, if possible.
Make sure your PR does not contain "Fixup" commits when publishing it, but feel
free to push "Fixup" commits in the review process. We will ask you to clean
your history before merging!
